### Authors and Acknowledgement

* **Isaac D. Griffith, Ph.D.** - Drastically reformatted the project into multiple modules and refactored several key
  areas for performance efficiency, maintainability, style, etc. However more work must be done. Is in the process of
  expanding the capabilities of this approach to be aligned with the needs of industry.
* **Miltiadis G. Siavvas, Ph.D.** - Developed the QATCH approach during their dissertation work. However, has not worked
  on it since
